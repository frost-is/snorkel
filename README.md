# Snorkel

Snorkel is an  open-source tool that leverages several open source applications (RAPL, Scaphandre, Nvidia-DCGM, Node Exporter, Prometheus and Grafana) to provide researchers with more various and granular metrics. Snorkel allows for an extraction of said metrics in a precise and concise manner using graphs and charts.

For the moment, only ImageNet inference benchmarks are on this repository, but more content will be added in the near future
